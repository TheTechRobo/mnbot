      # protection that it's not exploitable.
      # Namely, we trust Chrome, and it's sandboxing the untrusted parts away.
      # Also, it's not running as root anyway, which limits the syscalls it can actually do.
      # The alternative is to disable Chrome's sandboxing, which protects the host,
      # but leaves the container vulnerable.
